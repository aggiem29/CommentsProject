Rahul Vanni

This semester in AP Trampoline Construction, we covered the history of trampolines, how trampolines have impacted the world, different trampoline building methods, ideal trampoline materials, and how to create creative trampolines. Students completed homework research assignments, hands-on in-class activities, and a final project including building a trampoline of their design.
Rahul was sometimes prepared for class. You were sometimes ready with the required materials and arrived on time.
You have done a good job completing the homework. Your assignments are normally done creatively (a trait highly valued in this class). Your average homework score was 84.0 percent.
You were sometimes an active participant in group discussions. You were sometimes contributing to peer work and worked well with your classmates.
You have done a great job communicating with me this semester, and that has greatly contributed to their success in this class.
Your final project can best be described using these words: adequately sized, red, safe.
You created a good trampoline for your final exam! Nice job working through setbacks while constructing that trampoline. Your exam grade paired with your average homework grade has earned you a good grade in this class. Your final grade is 87.0 percent.
Your final grade for the semester is B.
